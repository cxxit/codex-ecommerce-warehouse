-- Table: warehouse.raw.olist_products_dataset
-- Olist exploration worksheet: write your own SQL in the blank spaces.
-- Scope: historical source snapshot in database warehouse; preserve raw unchanged.
-- Professional practice: reconcile source counts and record dataset version and check date.
-- Profiling describes observed data; validation compares evidence with justified expectations.
-- Record affected rows AND denominators; prioritize issues by analytical impact.
-- NULL differs from empty or whitespace text; distinct counts generally exclude NULL.
-- Samples help exploration but cannot prove completeness or uniqueness.
-- Declared nullability is not evidence of actual nulls; candidate keys need testing.
-- Preserve original values; propose staging treatments rather than changing raw.
-- Define grain before joins: a surrogate key cannot repair ambiguous source grain.
-- Repeat checks against the same snapshot; promote justified rules into automated tests.
-- Historical static data needs reproducibility, not an assumed live-feed freshness target.

-- BEGINNER: inventory, grain, keys, and completeness.
-- Task 1: Does the product count reconcile, and is product_id complete and unique?
-- Hint: Establish product dimension grain before linking item facts.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 2: Do duplicate product identifiers have identical or conflicting attributes?
-- Hint: A surrogate key does not resolve competing descriptions of the same business key.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 3: Which category and descriptive fields are missing together?
-- Hint: Investigate patterns of missingness instead of treating every missing field independently.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- INTERMEDIATE: validity, relationships, and business interpretation.
-- Task 4: Do count-like fields contain negative or fractional values despite floating-point storage?
-- Hint: Check product_name_lenght, product_description_lenght, and product_photos_qty; retain source spellings in raw.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 5: Are weights and dimensions complete, positive, and plausible in their stated units?
-- Hint: Examine zeroes and outliers separately; units matter when deriving volume or comparing shipping characteristics.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 6: Which product categories lack translations, and can translation joins multiply product rows?
-- Hint: Establish lookup-key uniqueness before enriching a dimension.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 7: Do order items reference missing products, and which products have no observed items?
-- Hint: Unused catalog entries and unresolved sold products have different analytical consequences.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- ADVANCED: analytical impact and dimensional modelling.
-- Task 8: How do missing categories or physical measurements affect category sales and freight analysis?
-- Hint: Quantify affected item rows and sales, not just the number of incomplete products.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 9: Which product attributes belong in the dimension, and what historical changes can this snapshot support?
-- Hint: Do not invent slowly changing dimension history without source change evidence; document unknown-category treatment.
