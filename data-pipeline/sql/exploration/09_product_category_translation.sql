-- Table: warehouse.raw.product_category_name_translation
-- Olist exploration worksheet: write your own SQL in the blank spaces.
-- Scope: historical source snapshot in database warehouse; preserve raw unchanged.
-- Professional practice: reconcile source counts and record dataset version and check date.
-- Profiling describes observed data; validation compares evidence with justified expectations.
-- Record affected rows AND denominators; prioritize issues by analytical impact.
-- NULL differs from empty or whitespace text; distinct counts generally exclude NULL.
-- Samples help exploration but cannot prove completeness or uniqueness.
-- Declared nullability is not evidence of actual nulls; candidate keys need testing.
-- Preserve original values; propose staging treatments rather than changing raw.
-- Define grain before joins: a surrogate key cannot repair ambiguous source grain.
-- Repeat checks against the same snapshot; promote justified rules into automated tests.
-- Historical static data needs reproducibility, not an assumed live-feed freshness target.

-- BEGINNER: inventory, grain, keys, and completeness.
-- Task 1: Does the mapping count reconcile, and what is the intended row grain?
-- Hint: A lookup table's size does not establish that its mapping key is unique.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 2: Is product_category_name present and unique? Are duplicate mappings identical or conflicting?
-- Hint: Conflicting translations require a documented resolution rather than arbitrary deduplication.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 3: Are source or English category names null, empty, or whitespace?
-- Hint: Distinguish missing keys from missing descriptive labels.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- INTERMEDIATE: validity, relationships, and business interpretation.
-- Task 4: Do case, whitespace, or spelling variations create apparent duplicate categories?
-- Hint: Compare original and proposed normalized representations before changing join keys.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 5: Do multiple source categories share one English label?
-- Hint: Display labels are not automatically safe business keys; merging them may change category reporting.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 6: Which nonmissing product categories lack translations, and which mappings are unused?
-- Hint: Missing product categories and unmatched category values are separate conditions.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 7: How many products, item rows, and item sales are affected by missing translations?
-- Hint: Measure downstream impact while ensuring the mapping join preserves grain.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- ADVANCED: analytical impact and dimensional modelling.
-- Task 8: How should category enrichment preserve unmatched products and distinguish missing from untranslated categories?
-- Hint: An inner join can silently remove sales; document fallback and unknown-member policies.




-- Evidence and interpretation:
-- Check date / dataset version / source filename:
-- Expected result and justification:
-- Observed result / affected rows / denominator:
-- Severity / analytical impact:
-- Proposed staging treatment / future automated test:

-- Task 9: What tests and version records would make category mappings reproducible?
-- Hint: Track source version, key uniqueness, mapping conflicts, and coverage; avoid using translated labels as immutable identity.
